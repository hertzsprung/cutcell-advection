Question: who else has developed numerical schemes that use polynomial best fits for interpolation?

-----------

- 1D, FV advection scheme for arbitrary grids
- polynomial interpolation follows Leonard (ULTIMATE, 1D [22], UTOPIA, 2D [23]), but these were for uniform grids only

- Leonard 1988: Universal Limiter for Transient Interpolation Modelling of the Advective Transport Equations: The ULTIMATE Conservative Difference Scheme
- Leonard 1993: Positivity preserving numerical schemes for multidimensional advection
