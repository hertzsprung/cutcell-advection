Existing transport schemes for atmospheric models can perform poorly over steep terrain because terrain-following coordinate transformations become close to singular, and schemes with horizontal--vertical dimension splitting can suffer from splitting errors.  Many multidimensional schemes are computationally expensive, remapping the entire domain at every time-step, or recalculating reconstruction weights for time-varying velocity fields.

This paper describes a new multidimensional transport scheme that avoids all splitting errors.  Its computational cost is comparable to dimensionally-split schemes, requiring only n multiplies per face per time-step, where n is the stencil size.  The scheme ensures numerical stability by enforcing von Neumann stability constraints during model initialisation.  The scheme is stable and accurate in a newly-formulated transport test over steep terrain on terrain-following and cut-cell meshes.
