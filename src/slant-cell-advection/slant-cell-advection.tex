\section{Introduction}

First, we present a multidimensional advection scheme that is computationally cheap and suitable for complex flows on a variety of meshes.  Second, we present a new type of Cartesian mesh, the slanted cell mesh, that avoids the small cell problem associated with cut cell meshes.   We apply the advection scheme to tests over steep orography and show that accurate results are obtained on slanted cell meshes.  Finally, we challenge the multidimensional advection scheme using a test of deformational flow on a geodesic mesh.

\section{Results}
\TODO{should I use RK4 or will RK2 suffice?}
\TODO{somewhere mention that the second-order convergence is a limitation of the divergence discretisation.  With more DoF a higher order should be achievable.}

\subsection{Horizontal transport with mesh refinement}
Coping with sudden changes in mesh spacing is necessary for some types of mesh refinement and mesh adaptivity.  We should use the horizontal advection test from \citet{schaer2002} on a BTF mesh with a 2x/4x/8x refined mesh in part of the mountainous region.  The tracer will have to pass into and out of this refined region.  This test will also help to familiarise the reader with this standard test.  We will modify parts of this test in the following subsection in order to test advection over the lower boundary.

\subsection{Transport over a mountainous lower boundary}
This test is a modification of the \citet{schaer2002} horizontal advection test.  The mountain height is raised, the wind field is aligned with the the terrain-following surfaces, and the tracer is moved downward so that it is advected over the ground.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Compare cubicFit with linearUpwind
	\item Compare errors on BTF, cut cells and slanted cells using a small timestep
	\item Show maximum timesteps for various mesh spacings using Courant number close to one
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}

The advection scheme is
\begin{itemize}
	\item suitable for complex flows on a variety of meshes
	\item computationally cheap at runtime, with more expensive computations depending only on the mesh geometry
	\item \TODO{convergence}
	\item stable for Courant numbers up to 1
\end{itemize}
