\subsection{Transport over a mountainous lower boundary}
This test is a modification of the \citet{schaer2002} horizontal advection test.  The mountain height is raised, the wind field is aligned with the the terrain-following surfaces, and the tracer is moved downward so that it is advected over the ground.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Compare cubicFit with linearUpwind
	\item Compare errors on BTF, cut cells and slanted cells using a small timestep
	\item Show maximum timesteps for various mesh spacings using Courant number close to one
\end{itemize}

	\TODO{I could overlay l2 and linf errors onto these plots.  Might be nicer than tabulating them separately.}}
