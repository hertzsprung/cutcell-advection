- The scheme is second-order convergent regardless of mesh distortions
- A von Neumann analysis ensures stability on arbitrarily-structured meshes
- Sub-grid reconstructions are mostly precomputed depending on the mesh geometry alone
- Slanted cell meshes avoid severe time-step constraints associated with cut cells
