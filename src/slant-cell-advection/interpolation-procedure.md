Polynomial fit approximation
============================

Here we explain how an interpolated value is obtained at a target face by fitting a polynomial surface onto a stencil of points.  In particular, this document focuses on the stabilisation procedure.

In two dimensions, the polynomial surface comprises nine terms, and a typical stencil in the interior of a quadritaleral mesh has twelve points.  A matrix is constructed having one row per stencil point.  Typically, the matrix has one column per polynomial term, though it may have fewer columns for particular stencil geometries.  The polynomial surface is fitted to the stencil point values using a least squares approach.

The stencils points adjacent to the target face are called *central points*.  The central point that is upwind is called the *upwind point*, and the other is called the *downwind point*.  The stencil points that are not central points are called *peripheral points*.  For a typical stencil geometry, the central points are given a large weighting in the least squares fit so that the polynomial surface passes almost exactly through these two points.  We refer to these collectively as the *central weights*, with the *upwind weight* and *downwind weight* applying to the upwind and downwind points individually.  At the time of writing, for typical stencil geometries, the central weights are 1000, and the peripheral points are given a weight of 1.

A least squares fit is obtained by applying a singular value decomposition to the matrix.  This yields a vector of *coefficients* which is dotted with the stencil point values to obtain the interpolated value at the target face.  Note the distinction between *weights*, which are applied during the construction of the matrix, and *coefficients*, which are the output of the least squares fit.

Stabilisation
-------------

In order to achieve numerical stability, the matrix may be manipulated for particular stencil geometries in two ways: by removing columns from the matrix, and by adjusting the stencil point weights.  For each flux direction through each face, the procedure is as follows:

1. The matrix is constructed one column at a time.  The columns corresponding to the lowest order terms are appended first, and the columns corresponding to the highest order terms are appended last.  After each column is appended, the singular values are examined to determine if the matrix is full-rank.  If any singular value is smaller than the threshold value, the matrix is considered rank-deficient (at the time of writing, the threshold value is 1e-3).  If the matrix is full-rank then we append another column corresponding to the next lowest-order term.  Otherwise, if matrix becomes rank-deficient having appended a column, then that column is removed from the matrix and another column is tried, corresponding to the next lowest-order term.
2. When the previous step is complete, the result is a full-rank matrix with up to nine columns.  Next, we find a combination of columns, that yields coefficients such that the magnitude of every peripheral coefficient is smaller than the smallest of the two central coefficients.   The combination with the largest number of members that satisfies this criterion is chosen.  This step is designed to find suitable sets of terms for stencils such as those below.  Note that this has not been justified with any analysis but, intuitively, we might expect those cells closest to the target face to have the largest coefficients.

3. Next, we enforce the stability criteria: c\_u >= |c\_p| + c\_d for every peripheral coefficient c\_p, where c\_u is the upwind coefficient and c\_d is the downwind coefficient.  The downwind weight is decremented by oneand a new vector of coefficients is generated.  This step is repeated until the stability criteria are satisified, or the downwind weight reaches one.
4. If step 3 did not yield a stable vector of coefficients, we abandon the high-order approximation and resort to fitting a bilinear surface with an upwind weight of 1000 and all other weights being 1.  This is intended to behave like OpenFOAM's linearUpwind scheme, although more work is needed to explain why linearUpwind has greater accuracy than the bilinear least squares fit.
5. If step 4 did not satisfy the stability criteria, then we resort to a simple upwind approximation for this stencil.  In our tests, step 4 has always satisfied the stability criteria.
