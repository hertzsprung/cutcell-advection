\begin{abstract}
The inclusion of terrain in atmospheric models gives rise to mesh distortions near the lower boundary that can degrade accuracy and challenge the stability of transport schemes.
Multidimensional transport schemes avoid all splitting errors on distorted and arbitrarily structured meshes, and Eulerian schemes have low computational cost, relying entirely on reconstructions at fixed points.

This paper presents a multidimensional Eulerian finite volume transport scheme, ``cubicFit'', which is designed to be numerically stable on arbitrary meshes and which is second-order convergent regardless of mesh distortions.
Constraints derived from a von Neumann stability analysis are imposed during model initialisation to obtain stability and improve accuracy in distorted regions of the mesh, and near steeply-sloping lower boundaries.
The reconstruction method has a low computational cost because most calculations depend upon the mesh only, with just one vector multiply per face needed per time-step.

The cubicFit scheme is evaluated using two, idealised numerical tests of atmospheric flow.  The first is a new test case that assesses accuracy near the ground by transporting a tracer over steep terrain on severely distorted terrain-following meshes and cut-cell meshes.
The second is a standard test case that deforms a tracer in a vortical flow on hexagonal icosahedra and cubed-sphere meshes.
In all tests, cubicFit is stable and largely insensitive to mesh distortions, and cubicFit results are more accurate than those obtained using a multidimensional linear upwind transport scheme.

\TODO{somewhere mention that the second-order convergence is a limitation of the divergence discretisation.  With more DoF a higher order should be achievable.} \\
\TODO{I might need to estimate the number of floating-point ops to enable a comparison between linearUpwind and cubicFit in terms of computational expense versus numerical accuracy}

\section{Conclusions}

The advection scheme is
\begin{itemize}
	\item suitable for complex flows on a variety of meshes
	\item computationally cheap at runtime, with more expensive computations depending only on the mesh geometry
	\item \TODO{convergence}
	\item stable for Courant numbers up to 1
\end{itemize}
