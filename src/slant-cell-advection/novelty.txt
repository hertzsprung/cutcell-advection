Existing transport schemes for atmospheric models can perform poorly over steep terrain because terrain-following coordinate transformations become close to singular, and splitting errors become apparent for schemes that use horizontal--vertical dimension splitting.  Many multidimensional schemes are computationally expensive, requiring the entire domain to be remapped at every time-step, or the recalculation of reconstruction weights for time-varying velocity fields.

This paper describes a new multidimensional transport scheme that avoids all splitting errors.  Its computational cost is comparable to dimensionally-split schemes, requiring only n multiplies per face per time-step, where n is the stencil size.
