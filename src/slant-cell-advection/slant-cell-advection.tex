	The terrain surface, denoted by a heavy dotted line, intersects a uniform rectangular grid comprising four cells, $c_1$, $c_2$, $c_3$ and $c_4$.  The cell vertices, marked by open circles, are moved upwards to the points at which the terrain intersects vertical cell edges, marked by open circles.  Cells that have no volume are removed.  Where a cell has two vertices occupying the same point, the zero-length edge that joins those vertices is removed.  In this illustration, cell $c_4$ is removed because it has no volume, and the zero-length edge at point $p$ is removed to create a triangular cell, $c_3$.}

\section{Multidimensional upwind-biased advection scheme}
A tracer with density $\phi$ is advected in flux form
\begin{align}
\partial \phi / \partial t + \nabla \cdot \left( \mathbf{u} \phi \right) = 0
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity field.  Using the notation that, for a field $\psi$, $\psi_f$ denotes the value of $\psi$ at face $f$.  $\psi_c$ denotes the value at the centroid of cell $c$, and $\psi_F$ is an interpolation onto a face from surrounding cell centre values.  The divergence term is discretised using Gauss' divergence theorem:
\begin{align}
	\nabla \cdot \left( \mathbf{u} \phi \right) \approx \frac{1}{\mathcal{V}} \sum_{f \in c} \phi_F \mathbf{u}_f \cdot \mathbf{S}_f
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{V}$ is the cell volume, $f \in c$ denotes the faces of the cell, and $\mathbf{S}_f$ is the outward-pointing normal vector for face $f$ with a magnitude equal to the face area.

\end{figure}

The value of $\phi_F$ is interpolated using a least squares fit of cell centre values from an upwind-biased stencil.

\subsection{Stencil construction}
The upwind-biased stencil is constructed by finding the opposing faces for a given face, $f$, belonging to a cell, $c$.  Defining $G$ to be the set of other faces in cell $c$, we calculate the `opposedness' between faces $f$ and $g \in G$, defined as
\begin{align}
	\mathrm{Opp}(f, g) \equiv - \frac{\mathbf{S}_f \cdot \mathbf{S}_g}{|\mathbf{S}_f|^2} \label{eqn:opp}
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{S}_f$ and $\mathbf{S}_g$ are the surface normal vectors pointing outward from cell $c$ for faces $f$ and $g$ respectively.
Using the fact that $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = |\mathbf{a}|\:|\mathbf{b}| \cos(\theta)$ we can rewrite equation~\ref{eqn:opp}:
\begin{align}
	\mathrm{Opp}(f, g) = - \frac{|\mathbf{S}_g|}{|\mathbf{S}_f|} \cos(\theta)
\end{align}
where $\theta$ is the angle between faces $f$ and $g$.  In this form, it can be seen that $\mathrm{Opp}$ is a measure of the size of $g$ and how closely it parallels face $f$.

Now, let $\mathrm{OF}$ be the set of faces opposing face $f$, which is defined as
\begin{align}
	\mathrm{OF} \equiv \{ g : \max(\mathrm{Opp}(f, g)) \} \cup \{ g : \mathrm{Opp}(f, g) \geq 0.5 \}
\end{align}
\TODO{can the opposed face be a boundary face?  I think this is desirable in order to find the upwind cell centre...}
The stencil includes cells adjacent to the faces in $\mathrm{OF}$, and their vertex neighbours.

	\includegraphics{../fig-double-upwind-stencil/fig-double-upwind-stencil.pdf}

	\caption{\TODO{}}
	\label{fig:double-upwind-stencil}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:double-upwind-stencil} illustrates a stencil construction for face $f$ and cell $c$.  The two opposing faces are denoted by thick dashed lines and the centres of the three neighbouring cells are marked by grey circles.  The stencil is extended outwards from the central cells by including the cells neighbouring the vertices marked by black squares.  The resultant stencil contains 13 cells.

\subsection{Singular value decomposition}
Once the stencil has been found, a multidimensional polynomial is fitted to the cell centre values.
In two dimensions, the polynomial is
\begin{align}
	\phi = a_1 + a_2 x + a_3 y + a_4 x^2 + a_5 xy + a_6 y^2 + a_7 x^3 + a_8 x^2 y + a_9 x y^2
\end{align}
where $x$ is in the direction of $\mathbf{S}_f$ and $y$ is perpendicular to $x$.  The term involving $y^3$ is omitted.
A matrix equation is constructed to calculate a least squares fit:
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{B} \mathbf{a} = \bm{\phi}
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{B}$ is a rectangular matrix with one row for each stencil cell and one column for each term in the polynomial, $\mathbf{a} = [a_1, \ldots, a_n]^\intercal$ with $n$ being the number of polynomial terms, and $\bm{\phi} = [\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m]^\intercal$ where $m$ is the number of cells in the stencil.

The matrix $\mathbf{B}$ takes the form
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{W_P} \circ \mathbf{W_C} \circ \mathbf{\tilde{B}} 
\end{align}
where $\circ$ denotes an element-wise product, $\mathbf{W_P}$ and $\mathbf{W_C}$ are $m \times n$ matrices of polynomial weights and stencil cell weights respectively.   $\mathbf{\tilde{B}}$ is a $m \times n$ matrix of the geometric terms in the polynomial which, in two dimensions, is given by
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{\tilde{B}} = 
	\begin{pmatrix}
		1 & \mathbf{x}_1 \cdot \iunit & \mathbf{x}_1 \cdot \junit & \left( \mathbf{x}_1 \cdot \iunit \right)^2 & \left( \mathbf{x}_1 \cdot \iunit \right) \left( \mathbf{x}_1 \cdot \junit \right) & \cdots \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}


First, a local coordinate system is established in which $x$ is in the direction of $\mathbf{S}_f$ and $y$ is perpendicular to $x$.
\TODO{in 3D, how do we choose y and z? does it even matter?}
The origin is fixed to be the target face centroid. 

A matrix equation is constructed
The vectors from the target face centroid to each cell centroid are expressed in

% cell weightings
% polynomial term weightings
% SVD provides us with  

% procedure:
% for each face and for both orientations:
% 1. find stencil
% 2. are we pureUpwind? compare upwind/downwind vectors
% 3. give upwind cell weighting of 1000
% 4. if !pureUpwind, also give downwind cell weighting of 1000
% 5. *1000 for 'a' and 'b' terms
% (rescale and reorientate, probably not crucial to mention)
% iterate up to 8 times (and at least once)
%   SVD for "B"
%   coeffsi[i] = 1000 * weight[i] * VSinvUt[0][i]
%   test for good fit criteria:
%   - mag(upwind cell weight correction) < linearLimitFactor
%   - upwind weight > downwind weight
%   - upwind weight > sum(other positive weights)
%   - max(weight) < 1
%   if good fit criteria are not met:
%   - upwind input weight *= 10
%   - if not pure upwind, remove downwind 1000 weighting (in wts and in B matrix) on the first iteration
%   - multiply all upwind weights by 10 in the SVD matrix
%   - multiply a and b polynomial terms by 10 for all cells
% finally, if good fit criteria are still not met, revert to standard 'upwind': phi_F \approx phi_U

% how do we find the contributing cells?
% what do we do if there aren't enough cells?
% need to define terminology for "weights":
% - weights fed into SVD
% - weights that come out of SVD

% linearLimitFactor documented in UpwindCorrFitScheme.H, is specified in fvSchemes, we have it set to 3
