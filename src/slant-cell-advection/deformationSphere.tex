\subsection{Deformational flow on a sphere}

\TODO{how much detail do I need about OpenFOAM's global Cartesian coordinates, lack of 2D meshes and our correction for spherical geometry?}

Tests on cubed sphere and hexagons, again comparing cubicFit against linearUpwind.  \citet{lauritzen2012} had six classes of test and we will reproduce three of them:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item convergence tests with Gaussian hills
	\item minimal resolution test with cosine bell
	\item cosine bell in divergent flow
\end{enumerate}
We will not consider filament preservation, a "rough" distribution with a slotted cylinder, or correlation preservation.

Cosine bells initial condition also plotted.  This figure is supposed to give a sense of what `should' happen, so plot at a high resolution using whichever mesh gives better results.}}

\subsubsection{``Minimal'' resolution using cosine bells}

	\caption{\TODO{$\ell_2$ convergence for non-divergent deformational flow using Cosine bells.  Used to find ``minimal'' resolution.  Plot for hexagons and cubed sphere, cubicFit and linearUpwind.  Plot a heavy line for minimal resolution, as in \citet{lauritzen2012} figure 5.}}

\subsubsection{Transport under divergent flow conditions using cosine bells}

	\caption{\TODO{divergent flow at $t=T/2$ and $t=T$ comparing cubed sphere and hexagons, cubicFit and linearUpwind.  Corresponds to \citet{lauritzen2012} figure 9.}}
