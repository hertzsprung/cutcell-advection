\subsection*{Stability}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The slanted cell method improves the numerical representation of hydrostatic balance over steep orography compared to terrain-following meshes but requires a new advection scheme that is stable (and accurate) --- \TODO{but the spurious velocities are small on terrain-following meshes anyway, so why should we use slanted cells?} --- \svisor{lots of models have stability problems at steep terrain, e.g. in early 2000s Adrian Simmons found ECMWF model crashed with gravity waves excited by cliffs at Antarctic coast, UKMO New Dynamics crashes were frequently over the Andes or Himalayas}
	\item Application of von Neumann stability analysis is unique to the best of my knowledge --- \TODO{but it's not entirely effective, I'm still finding meshes and wind fields that satisfy the stability criteria but are actually unstable}
	\item The stability analysis technique could be applied to any equation in any domain --- \TODO{perhaps, but this hasn't been done}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Computationally cheap}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Computationally cheap, just a vector dot product (unlike most swept-area schemes that require a matrix-vector multiply \citep{lashley2002,skamarock-menchaca2010,thuburn2014}) --- \TODO{but have we traded accuracy for computational efficiency and was it really worth it?}
	\item \svisor{Small amount of work per time-step will mean multi-tracer efficiency}
	\item Small stencil permits lots of parallelisation --- \TODO{surely true of any scheme with a Courant number $\leq 1$}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Multidimensionality}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Not susceptible to splitting errors (unlike models such as CAM-FV, UKMO Dynamo) --- \TODO{but \citep{weller2017} shows that splitting errors are negligible for all but the steepest of terrain, so does it really matter, especially given the gains in computational efficiency by using a dimensionally-split transport scheme?} --- \svisor{dimension splitting has very similar cost to cubicFit}
	\item No special treatment for the corners of cubed-sphere panels (unlike \TODO{citation, check weller2017}) or for hexagonal geometry (unlike \TODO{citation, gassmann?}) --- \TODO{that's nice, but if the special treatments are effective, then does it matter?}
	\item Multidimensional in arbitrary dimensions.  We use the scheme on an $x$--$z$ plane but no special treatment would be needed for 3D multidimensional --- \TODO{many other schemes would generalise to 3D multidimensional, too, but is there any motivation for doing so?}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Arbitrary meshes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Suitable for arbitrary meshes including terrain-following meshes, cut cells, cubed-spheres and hexagonal icosahedra --- \TODO{but real models choose their grid upfront and choose a suitable transport scheme to go with it, do they really need this flexibility?} --- \svisor{\emph{Existing} models don't need this flexibility}
	\item Suitable for steep slopes --- \TODO{is this really a problem?  e.g. ECMWF say they have no problem with steep slopes}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Miscellaneous}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Second-order accurate on distorted meshes (really?) unlike \citep{skamarock-gassmann2011} --- \TODO{only demonstrated properly in 1D, in 2D sometimes the scheme diverges, it doesn't even converge!}
	\item Eulerian schemes are less restrictive than semi-Lagrangian schemes for small-scale rotational flow because non-simply connected domains are permitted \citep{lauritzen2011book} --- \TODO{other Eulerian schemes already exist}
	\item Eulerian schemes allow choice in timestepping, e.g. optimized Runge--Kutta schemes could allow Courant numbers $> 1$ (as mentioned by John Thuburn) --- \TODO{true for any Eulerian scheme} --- \svisor{Yes but there are very few Eulerian schemes out there}
	\item Possibility of super-convergence --- \TODO{only been achieved in 1D, not in 2D/3D}
	\item Standard limiters could be applied --- \TODO{hasn't been done, true of many schemes}
	\item Conservative (unlike UKMO EndGame which suffers from eternal fountain of moisture) --- \TODO{so are all other finite volume transport schemes}
\end{itemize}
