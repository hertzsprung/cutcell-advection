\section{Introduction}

First, we present a multidimensional advection scheme that is computationally cheap and suitable for complex flows on arbitrary meshes.  Second, we present a new type of Cartesian mesh, the slanted cell mesh, that avoids the small cell problem associated with cut cell meshes.   We apply the advection scheme to tests over steep orography and show that accurate results are obtained on slanted cell meshes.  Finally, we challenge the multidimensional advection scheme using a test of deformational flow on a geodesic mesh.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Deformational flow}
Following \citep{lauritzen2012}.  \TODO{which of the initial conditions should I use?  slotted cylinder would be the hardest}

\section{Conclusions}

The slanted cell method
\begin{itemize}
	\item alleviates the small cell problem
	\item has a linear relationship between mesh spacing and maximum timestep because arbitrarily small cells are not created
	\item accurately represents a hydrostatically balanced atmosphere at rest over steep Alpine terrain
	\item is straightforward to construct compared to the cut cell method
	\item generalises to 3D, applicable to any horizontal mesh structure
\end{itemize}

The advection scheme is
\begin{itemize}
	\item suitable for complex flows on arbitrary meshes
	\item computationally cheap at runtime, with more expensive computations depending only on the mesh geometry
	\item fourth-order convergent at best, first-order convergent at worst
	\item stable for Courant numbers up to 1
\end{itemize}

Idealised atmospheric flows over steep slopes are accurately represented using the multidimensional advection scheme without severely constraining the timestep.  The multidimensional advection scheme is suitable for complex flows on arbitrary meshes.
